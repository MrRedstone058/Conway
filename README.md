# Conway
There are two files: one in c++ and the other in python. Made in July 2022 to test the speed of c++ because I just started learning it a week ago or so.

There are probably ways to optimise it, but this is just a trivial test and so I'm too lazy and so just left it like that. I might have written some bad code in c++, but I'll see what i can do.

And yes for c++ I borrowed some code for calculating the fps but I can't remember where...
